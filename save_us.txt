Hi there,
     I used to run Good Morning CMC but I graduated last year. I'm writing
because this project is dying and I'd like to offer you the opportunity to save
it.

This was a labor of love. It takes a lot of work to write the email every day.
That said, doing this every day is the main reason I have an engineering job at
an internet startup right now, more so than CS classes. It's likely you will
learn a lot from maintaining this project as well.

I am a pretty bad programmer but I was a *really* bad programmer when I wrote
most of this. So there's a bunch of stuff that you could work on to make it
better, like actually doing marketing and advertising - I made about $300 in
one semester without trying hard to advertise to people and I'm sure you could
double or triple that by getting recruiters to advertise, for example. If you'd
like more examples of ways to contribute, shoot me an email.

I fully expect this project will die. That said, if you're interested in taking
it on, I promise to do the following:

- I will do my best to help you get an internship/full time job at a tech
company in Silicon Valley, including reviewing your resume, discussing roles
that would be a good fit, listing companies that would be a good fit for you,
and making introductions at those companies.

- I will help you learn how to update the website, schedule the emails
every night, etc.

- I will advise you on any other tech or school-related issues you are working
on.

- You will get unlimited free Twilio credit for life :)

If you are mildly interested shoot me an email; if you are really interested,
copy the source code on Github (https://github.com/kevinburke/goodmorningcmc)
and submit a pull request (http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/), or
write the email for Friday/Monday and ask what else you need to do to send it.

Make useful things and improve yourself,
Kevin
