# Open the Terminal and type this:
$ which -a brew
/usr/local/bin/port # if the 'which' command returns nothing you don't have
                    # Homebrew installed or it's not in your path. Try
                    # typing 'echo $PATH' or email me

# Then install Git (hg). It lets you keep track of different versions of
# the site. This will take a while as there are a lot of things that have to be
# installed before Git can run properly.
$ brew install git

# Install flask. Flask is a microframework used to display the pages on the

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

# At this point it should do a whole bunch of installation stuff... should take
# about 5 minutes.

#make sure flask is installed for your current version of python, to test,
#open python and try typing `import flask`. There should be no errors when you
#do so.
